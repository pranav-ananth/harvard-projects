The next problem will get you familiar with it's indexing capabilities.\n","\n","Given a 2D numeric numpy matrix `A`, a row index `r`, and a column index `c`, return the sum of the row vector of `A` at index `r` and the column vector of `A` at index `c` (following python indexing rules, i.e., starts at zero and supports positive and negative indexing). Edge cases to handle are invalid index values for the matrix `A` and summing vectors of different size (this happens when the width and height of the matrix are different) - the return value for these cases should be `None`.\n","\n","**Hint**: Documentation on [numpy operations](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/numpy/basic-array-operations), [numpy array splicing](https://machinelearningmastery.com/index-slice-reshape-numpy-arrays-machine-learning-python/), [`np.transpose`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.transpose.html), [`np.ndarray.ndim`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.ndim.html), and [`np.ndarray.shape`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html) will be helpful.
